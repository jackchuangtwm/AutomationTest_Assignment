#Assignment 1: Excel Application
#Part 1
#There is a score table of the English students.
#Student	Reading	Listening	Speaking	Writing
#Student A	80	75	88	80
#Student B	88	86	90	95
#Student C	92	85	92	98
#Student D	81	88	80	82
#Student E	75	80	78	80
#Generate a spreadsheet for the score table using Python.

                                         3: 'Student D', 4: 'Student E'},

#Part 2
#The below table presents the weights of different section of the score.
#Section	Weight
#Reading	20%
#Listening	25%
#Speaking	30%
#Writing	25%
#Write a Python script to read the value from spreadsheet, and calculate the Weighted Average for each student.

#Expected Output:
#student: Student A, score: 81.15
#student: Student B, score: 89.85
#student: Student C, score: 91.75
#student: Student D, score: 82.7
#student: Student E, score: 78.4

#Assignment 2: Exception Handling
#Complete the following functions by Python

#division(): print the result of division.
#Throw ZeroDivisionError if y is 0.
#Throw TypeError if y is not an integer.
#Whether an exception occurs or not, it will Print "---Finish---"

# Assignment 3: Algorithm Practice (Advanced Optional)
# Given an array nums.
# We define a running sum of an array as running_sum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
# Return the running sum of nums.

def running_sum(nums):  

    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
       nums[i] += nums[i - 1]

    return nums


print(running_sum([1, 2, 3, 4])) # Should be [1, 3, 6, 10] because [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4]
